# Question 1

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

``` r
nyc_sub = read_csv(file = "NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", na = c(".", "NA", ""))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
nyc_sub <- janitor::clean_names(nyc_sub)
nyc_filtered <- nyc_sub |> select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |> mutate(entry = case_match(entry, "YES" ~ TRUE, "NO" ~ FALSE))
```

Write a short paragraph about this dataset – explain briefly what
variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so
far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset.
Are these data tidy?

The data sleaning steps include using the `select` and `mutate` function
to select the columns we want to use and the mutate function to replace
the column with the specification we want to apply.  
It is a 19 \* 1868 table.

``` r
ncol(nyc_filtered)
```

    ## [1] 19

``` r
nrow(nyc_filtered)
```

    ## [1] 1868

Answer the following questions using these data:

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
nrow(distinct(nyc_filtered, pull(nyc_filtered, station_name)))
```

    ## [1] 356

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
nyc_filtered |> 
  filter(ada == T) |> 
  nrow() 
```

    ## [1] 468

468 stations are ADA compliant. What proportion of station entrances /
exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
(nyc_filtered |> 
   filter(vending == "NO", entry == TRUE) |>
   nrow()) / nrow(nyc_filtered)
```

    ## [1] 0.0369379

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train?

``` r
#only the first 7 routes have the type char, means the rest would not contain "A"
rform_nyc <- 
  nyc_filtered |> 
  select(-(route8:route11))
rform_long <- 
  rform_nyc |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("route"), 
               names_to = "route_type", 
               values_to = "route_name") |> 
  filter(!is.na(route_name))
a_train_stations <- 
  rform_long |> 
  filter(route_name == "A") |> 
  distinct(station_name)
nrow(a_train_stations)
```

    ## [1] 56

Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
rform_long |> 
  filter(route_name == "A",entry == TRUE) |> 
  distinct(station_name) |> 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 55

# Question 2

Import data and combine them

``` r
mr_trash <- 
  read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
             range = "A2:N653", 
             na = c("NA", "", ".")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls), 
         type = "mr_trash", 
         year = as.numeric(year))
pro_trash <- 
  read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
             range = "A2:M120", 
             na = c("NA", "", ".")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(type = "pro_trash")
gwynnda <- 
  read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", 
             range = "A2:L265", 
             na = c("NA", "", ".")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(type = "gwynnda") 
# I don't think it is necessary to include the month and year in it since it has already had the data, also move the type at front to let it looks more clean. 
total_df <- 
  bind_rows(mr_trash, pro_trash, gwynnda) |> 
  select(-month, -year) |> 
  relocate(type)
nrow(total_df)
```

    ## [1] 1032

``` r
ncol(total_df)
```

    ## [1] 13

Firstly read the three dataset and cleaned it by using
`na=c("NA", "", ".")` and `janitor::clean_names()`. For the mr trash
dataset, round the number of sprts balls to the nearest integer and
converts the result to an integer variable. As the `year` variable in
mr_trash dataset is char type, it was transfered into double type by
using `as.numeric`. By using the `bind_rows()` function, three dataset
are combined. `month` and `year` are removed due to the repeat of it in
`data` . `type` is moved into the first column.

``` r
#Total weight collected by Professor Trash Wheel
total_weight_pro_trash <- 
  total_df |> 
  filter(type == "pro_trash") |> 
  select(weight_tons) |> 
  sum(na.rm= TRUE)
total_weight_pro_trash
```

    ## [1] 246.74

``` r
#Total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022 
num_cigarette <- 
  gwynnda |> 
  filter(year == 2022, month == "June") |> 
  select(cigarette_butts) |> 
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
num_cigarette
```

    ## [1] 18120

The number of observations are 1032, and the key variables include the
weight of trash in tons, and the number of cigarette butts each dumpster
collected. The total weight collected by Professor Trash Wheel is
246.74. Total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of
2022 is 18120

# Question 3

By using `anti_join()`, from bakes into results, I found that the Joanne
could possibly the Joe. And the rest unmatched results belongs to series
9 and 10, which didn’t show up in the bakes dataset.

``` r

By using `anti_join()`, from bakes into bakers, I found that there are
more *baker* in bakers dataset, this is because it include baker in
series 9 and 10, which are not included in bakes dataset.

``` r
anti_join(bakes, bakers, by = "baker")
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 5
    ## # ℹ 5 variables: series <dbl>, episode <dbl>, baker <chr>,
    ## #   signature_bake <chr>, show_stopper <chr>

This means all the *baker* in bakers dataset are included in the bakes
dataset.

``` r
anti_join(bakers, results, by = "baker")
```

Jo is in bakers dataset but not in results dataset.

``` r
anti_join(results, bakers, by = "baker")
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 × 5

    ## 8      2       8 Joanne         1 WINNER

Joanne is in result dataset but not in the bakers dataset. So I think Jo
is Joanne based on the results of this dataset

``` r
results_new <- results |>
  mutate(baker = replace(baker, baker == "Joanne", "Jo"))
```

``` r
combined_df <- 
  results_new |> 
  left_join(bakers, by = c("baker","series")) |> 
  left_join(bakes, by = c("series", "episode", "baker"))|>
  arrange(baker) |> 
  rename(first_name = baker) |> 
  relocate(first_name, last_name) |>
  drop_na(result)
```

Start to join the table, index use baker, series, and episode to combine
*bakers* into *results_new*. The reason is that results contains the
most of *baker* and combining this two will return the full list of
names, even with the *baker* in series 9 and 10 which are not included
in the bakes dataset. Then combine *bakes* dataset into combined dataset
by *series*, *episode*, *baker*. Also, in Bakes, there is a “Jo”, but in
the results, there is not Jo, and in bakers, there is Jo. So we use the
`case_match()` to changed the format of “Jo” in *bakes* dataset for the
convenience of future combining.  

I re-arrange the dataset based on the first name since I am recording
each person’s data and I think it would be necessary to put the baker’s
first name in the first column for clearness. Then I drop the NA results
since NA appears after a person is out so putting NA there after they
are out doesn’t seems making sense.  

My question is about Jo, I think based on result from `anti_join`, Jo
should be Joanne.

``` r
combined_df |> 
  filter(result == "[a]")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 11
    ##   first_name last_name series episode technical result baker_age

    ## # ℹ 4 more variables: baker_occupation <chr>, hometown <chr>,
    ## #   signature_bake <chr>, show_stopper <chr>

There is a \[a\] in the result which happened above, this is left here
and worth further discussion.

Before episode 10, all the names in the table are the star bakers. The
name on last episode(episode 10) is the winner. Usually the winner were
star baker, except David, which is a surprise

    ## 10      1      10  NA

To clarify, I think both two tables make sense for different porpose.

``` r
mean_season1 <- 
  longer_viewers |>
  filter(series == 1) |>
  pull(viewer) |>
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)

mean_season5 <- longer_viewers |>
  filter(series == 5) |>
  pull(viewer) |>
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The average viewership in season 1 is 2.77, in season 5 is 10.0393
